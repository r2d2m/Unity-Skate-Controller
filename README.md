# About The Unity Skate Controller

The "Unity Skate Controller" is a skate/player controller for skate games including all you need such as physics and tricks and grinding and other stuff! This project is early alpha and don't expect it to run smoothly! (still download it and see for yourself". You can add your own animations and everything! This was orginally going to be made for another game but things happen so now it's yours! Dont expect the script to be perfect and its still getting updated and worked on constantly daily but hopefully you can use this as the foundation or groundwork for your game or other skate/player controller project yk!. Please make sure to star the repo so I can continue being happy
